<h1 id="warhol-heading">Andy Warhol</h1>
- Warhol was the son of Slovak immigrants and grew up in Pittsburgh. He displayed artistic talent from a young age and went on to study commercial art at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University)
- In the 1950s, Warhol moved to New York City, where he began working as a commercial illustrator. He quickly gained recognition for his distinctive, colorful drawings and designs.
- Warhol established a studio called "The Factory," which became a hub for creative expression and a gathering place for artists, musicians, actors, and counterculture figures in New York City. It was at The Factory that he produced his famous silkscreen prints and films.

### Notable Works
- Campbell's Soup Cans
- Marilyn Diptych
- Self-Portrait
- Eight Elvises

### Campbell's Soup Cans
- The "Campbell's Soup Cans" series was a pivotal moment in the emergence of Pop Art. What makes this series significant is the way Warhol elevated everyday, mass-produced objects to the status of art. He used a silkscreen technique to reproduce the Campbell's soup labels in a precise and repetitive manner. This repetition served as a commentary on consumer culture, the monotony of everyday life, and the ways in which we often overlook or take for granted familiar objects.

<h1 id="lichtenstein-heading">Roy Lichtenstein</h1>

- Lichtenstein was born on October 27, 1923, in New York City. He grew up in an artist                                               ic family, which influenced his early interest in art.
- In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein transitioned into pop art, a movement that celebrated and critiqued popular culture. His works often featured enlarged and bold renditions of comic book panels, advertising imagery, and everyday objects.
- Lichtenstein's art both celebrated and critiqued the superficiality and commercialism of American consumer culture. He questioned the boundary between high and low art by elevating popular imagery to the status of fine art.

### Notable Works
- Whaam!
- Drowning Girl
- Look Mickey
- Girl with a Hair Ribbon

### Signature Style
- Lichtenstein's distinctive style included the use of Ben-Day dots, bold black outlines, and primary colors, which emulated the appearance of comic book printing. His works often incorporated speech bubbles with humorous or poignant captions.

<h1 id="johns-heading">Jasper Johns</h1>

- Johns was born on May 15, 1930, in Augusta, Georgia. He grew up in South Carolina and later moved to New York City, where he attended art school.
- In the mid-1950s, Jasper Johns gained recognition for his unique approach to art. He is most famous for his early works that featured everyday objects, particularly the American flag and numbers.
- Johns often used numbers and letters as recurring motifs in his art. He transformed these symbols into complex and visually engaging compositions that challenged viewers to consider the nature of representation.
- Johns was known for his use of encaustic, a painting technique that involves mixing pigment with hot wax. This method added texture and depth to his work.

### Notable Works
- Flag
- Target with Four Faces
- "Numbers" Series
- Painted Bronze
