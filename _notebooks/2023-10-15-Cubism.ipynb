    "- Cubism was a revolutionary art movement that emerged in the early 20th century, pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.\n",
    "- It sought to deconstruct traditional perspective and representation, focusing on depicting objects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously.\n",
    "- The movement emphasized geometric shapes, complex angles, and fragmented forms, challenging the conventional notions of art and representation.\n",
    "- Artists often depicted subjects in a fragmented and abstracted manner, breaking them down into basic geometric shapes like cubes, spheres, and cones.\n",
    "- Cubist artworks often featured a monochromatic or limited color palette, highlighting the focus on form, texture, and structure rather than realistic representation.\n",
    "- The movement had two distinct phases: Analytical Cubism, characterized by the deconstruction of form and color, and Synthetic Cubism, which incorporated elements of collage and assemblage.\n",
    "- Cubism had a significant influence on subsequent art movements, including Futurism, Dadaism, and Constructivism, contributing to the development of modern art and challenging the traditional boundaries of artistic expression.\n",
