    "- Impressionism was an influential art movement that emerged in France during the late 19th century, primarily in the 1860s and 1870s.\n",
    "- The movement is characterized by a focus on capturing the immediate and transient effects of light and atmosphere, often through plein air painting and a vivid, naturalistic use of color.\n",
    "- Impressionist artists aimed to depict the changing qualities of natural light and the ephemeral aspects of everyday scenes, often portraying landscapes, cityscapes, and contemporary leisure activities.\n",
    "- The movement marked a significant departure from traditional academic painting, with artists opting for looser brushwork, a brighter palette, and an emphasis on capturing the sensation or \"impression\" of a scene rather than its precise details.\n",
    "- Prominent Impressionist painters included Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro, among others, each contributing to the movement's development and popularization.\n",
    "- Impressionism had a profound impact on the course of modern art, paving the way for subsequent movements such as Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism, and influencing artists across Europe and beyond in their approach to depicting the world around them."
